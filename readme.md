# Requirements
In order for the game to work, you need to write JavaScript that will interact with your HTML elements. The requirements for the game are:

Players can click on a cell in order to make a move.
X is always the first player.
After each move, the board is checked for a winner or a draw.
If there is a winner or draw, show a message that announces the winner or declares a draw.
Clicking the board when a game is over should reset the board so that a new game can be played.



# Coding the Game

To code the game, you're going to have to stretch yourself especially if this is the first time you've coded anything to completion. The lecture on adding interactivity gives you all the necessary components, but now you have to problem solve in order to bring it all together.

You'll need to use the document object to access your HTML elements. Use these hints to guide you:

The functions you'll need to use are:
document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll
textContent property of the cells.
The click event passes in an object that has a target property. This is the element that was clicked!
addEventListener will let you respond to events on an element like "click".



# How to get started

To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next playerâ€™s chance.
At each move, The game will show whose move it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:
     Winner
     Draw
     Restart
